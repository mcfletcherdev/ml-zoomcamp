# 🚀 Machine Learning Journey Tracker

Welcome to my **learning in public** adventure through machine learning via the Dataclub ML-Zoomcamp!

This repo documents my progress through a 12-module curriculum covering everything from basic ML to deep learning deployment.

I'll be updating this as I go ✅

## ✍️ How I Use This

- I’ll check the box when a module is **in progress** or **completed**.
- I’ll add short notes or links to my write-ups, notebooks, or blog posts.
- This README is the heart of my **learning in public** effort—transparent and consistent 🚀
